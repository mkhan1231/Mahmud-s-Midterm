Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Computer programs are instructions that we give to a computer that it will understand

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK are a set of tools and libraries that are needed to run a java program.
jdk contains javac, which compiles java soure code. we also java tool which exucutes the bytecode from the java compiler.
we also have jar tool which conatins classes and methods that accomplish a specific task

What is IDE?
A.IDE stands for integrated development environment. it is here that we write our java source code

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.some popular ones include eclipse,intellij and netbeans

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.we start with our source code in IDE. this gets converted to bytecode by the java compiler.
then the byte code is loaded into memory by the class loader and executed by the jvm into machine code

what is class?
A.a class is a blueprint of the states and behaviors of a certain type of model

What is object?
A.an object is a instance of a certain class with its own unique fields and behaviors

What is the entry point of an application?
A.the entry point of any java application is the main method

Why main is static?
A.if main was not static we would always have to create an instance of the main's class in order to use it

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.the super class of all classes is the object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.path is used to store the location of jdk tools like javac or java, but classpath is used to store the location of the
flies and folders your application needs to run properly

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.in an interface all methods must be declared only. In an abstract class you can have both abstract and non abstract method.
classes can implement many interfaces, but only one abstract class

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.interfaces and abstract classes cannot be instansiated, the only way to use them is for a class to implement a interface or extend an abstract class

what is Access Specifier?
A.Acess specifiers establish the permissions we have to access or modify members of a class within a certain scope.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.oop stands for object oriented programming. all java applications are based on the concept of objects.
there are oop concepts:
inheritence: this is when a class has access to the members of its parent without having to be reimplemented.
polymorhism: this is when a class can change the methods of its parents class to fit its specific needs as well as add its own members
encapsulation: this is when we restrict the scope of certain members so that they cannot be manipulated outside of the class where they
are defined, this is achieved with the "private keyword";
abstraction: abstraction is the process of implentation hiding. we use it when we want certain features to be implemented but we dont care
how it is implemented

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.a package is simply a folder or directory that stores related files and applications for easy access and readability
The default package is an unnamed package. The unnamed package contains java classes whose source files did not contain a package declaration.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.API stands for Application programming interface, it is essentially a service that we use to commuicate one computer
with another.
We have used the instagram api, the google maps api, the calender api

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.java does not allow multiple inheritence, only One parent can be inherited from, but we can get around this by implementing
as many interfaces as we want.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.mehtod overloading is when differtent methods with same name can exist as long as they have different parameters.
this occurs during compile time

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.exceptions are any event that disrupt the natural flow of an application, but can be handled without the need to
terminate the application

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.the static keyword indicates that a member belongs to a class rather than a object. static variables are shared by all objects
and static methods can be accessed without needing a object reference

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.the final keyword indicates that a member cannot be changed once declared. a final variabe cannot be changed
and a final method cannot be overrided

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.finally is a block of code that executes after a try catch block for code cleanup,
 finalize is a method called by java garbage collector that closes any open resources before destroying a object

What is a constructor ?
A.a constructor is used to create an object

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.Yes we can have multiple constructors

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.the default constructor is called

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.the this keyword is used to reference the current object whose method is being called

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.the super keyword is a reference to the parent class of an object

What is JVM stand for ?
A.JVM stands for java virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.yes it is

What version of java are you using?
A.version 1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
A.jar stands for java archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.jdk stores all the tools and files need by java to run properly, Jvm is the executioner of java bte code

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.jvm is the virtual machine that executes bytecode it is inside JRE which contains other libraries and components needed to
run java aplications

What is compile time and run time?
A.compile time is the stage when source code converted to byte code, runtime is when the byte code is being executed

What is heap?
A.heap is a section of ram in which all objects are stored

How java manage it's memory?
A.all references are stored in stack, all objects are stored in heap

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String is immutable stringBuffer and stringBuilder are not, stringBuffer is thread safe, StringBuilder is not

What is Singleton class?
A.a singleton class is a class that allows only one instance object to be created

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.serialization is the process of converting objects to bytestream, Deserialization is the opposite process

when to use transient variable in java?
A.when we do not want a variable to serialized

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.do while will execute atleast once, whileloop will not execute if a condition is not met

What is Enum?
A.enum is a set of constants that are user defined

What is Iterator?
A.iterator is a method of the Iterable interface that is used to traverse over a collection

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.an integer will take more memory because it is a object

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.Strings are immutable because we cannot change their states once they are instantiated

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.serial GC is used for single threaded environments, while Parallel GC is used in multithreaded environments

What is JIT stands for?
A.The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Java Runtime Environment that improves the performance of Java applications at run time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Heap space is the section of memory where objects are stored, Garbage collection clears the heap of any objects that are not being used

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.in java garbage collection is automatic but it cannot be forced and it is not clear when the collection will occur

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.stacks hold object references  and local primitive variables, heaps store the actual objects

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged
with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.

what is multithreading in java?
A.Multithreading is a Java feature that allows two or more parts of a program to run at the same time  for maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.we use sychronization to allow only one thread to access a cpu resource at a time.

What is Framework?
A.a framework is a large body of files or classes that we can add to our own code in order to solve a need

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.the main two are testng and Junit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.testng has all the features of junit plus added features such as dependency testing, group testing,object testing,

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.
what is dependency injection in java?
A.dependency injection is when a object conatians the dependencies of another object and is passed to it so that it can use it

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
static binding refers to the calls that can be resolved at compilation time while, dynamic binding are the calls that can be resolved
only at runtime
